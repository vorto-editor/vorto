//! Pane layout + buffer-pool boundary.
//!
//! ## Design summary
//!
//! - **Buffers** are the document model. They are owned at the
//!   application level — never by a pane. The active pane's buffer is
//!   held directly in `App.buffer` (a long-standing field referenced
//!   in many call sites); every other buffer that is currently visible
//!   in some pane lives in `App.parked_buffers`, keyed by
//!   [`crate::buffer_ref::BufferRef`]. Hidden buffers (not displayed
//!   in any pane) stay in the existing `App.sleeping` map.
//!
//! - **Panes** are display regions. A pane carries nothing more than a
//!   `BufferRef` pointing into the application's buffer pool, so
//!   `<space>b` from any pane can swap that ref to whatever the user
//!   picks. The `(PaneId → BufferRef)` mapping lives on `App` in
//!   `App.pane_refs`; this module just provides the layout tree and
//!   focus / split helpers.
//!
//! - **Tabs** are not implemented yet. The design here keeps tabs
//!   trivial to add later — each `Tab` would own a [`PaneLayout`],
//!   a `pane_refs` map, and an `active_pane`; the buffer pool stays
//!   shared at the `App` level so a buffer can appear in any tab.
//!
//! ## Two-pane sharing
//!
//! v1 does not support the same buffer being displayed in two panes
//! at once. The active buffer lives in `App.buffer` while every parked
//! buffer lives in `App.parked_buffers`; both can't be the same `Buffer`
//! struct simultaneously. `Self::switch_active_pane_buffer` rejects a
//! swap that would alias a buffer already shown by another pane. A
//! future refactor — splitting per-pane viewport state out of `Buffer`
//! — would lift this restriction.
