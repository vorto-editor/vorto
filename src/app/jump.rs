//! Two-character label jump (`gw`) — the "easymotion / hop / leap"
//! style overlay.
//!
//! When the user presses `gw`, every word start in the visible viewport
//! gets a 2-character label drawn over its first few cells. The user
//! then types the label to jump:
//!
//! - First keypress filters to labels starting with that char. If only
//!   one matches, the jump fires immediately.
//! - Second keypress disambiguates within that filtered set and jumps.
//! - Esc (or any key that matches no remaining label) cancels.
//!
//! Targets are word starts (vim's `\w` char-class: alphanumeric + `_`).
//! Labels are drawn from an ergonomics-first alphabet (home row first)
//! and assigned by `i % N` for the first char, `i / N` for the second
//! so consecutive targets get distinct first chars — meaning a small
//! number of targets all jump on a single keypress.
