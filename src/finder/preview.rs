//! Fuzzy-finder source-preview cache and worker thread.
//!
//! The picker's right pane shows a syntax-highlighted view of the file
//! under the cursor. Building that view (grammar dlopen, query compile,
//! file read, full tree-sitter parse) is too expensive to do on the
//! draw path, so it happens on a dedicated worker thread; this module
//! owns the worker and the LRU cache of finished previews.
//!
//! Flow:
//!
//! 1. Draw code asks the LRU for `path`. On hit it renders highlighted.
//! 2. On miss, draw code sends `path` to the worker via `preview_tx`
//!    and renders plain text for that frame.
//! 3. Worker reads the file, builds a [`PreviewEntry`], and hands it
//!    back through the supplied `emit` closure. The main loop installs
//!    it in the LRU and the next frame renders with highlights.
//!
//! The worker drains its channel before each unit of work so a fast
//! `j`/`k` scroll only triggers one parse for the final selection.
